                        Business intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process for analyzing data and
                        presenting actionable information to help corporate executives, business managers
                        and other end users make more informed business decisions. BI encompasses a variety
                        of tools, applications and methodologies that enable organizations to collect data
                        from internal systems and external sources, prepare it for analysis, develop and
                        run queries against the data, and create reports, dashboards and data visualizations
                        to make the analytical results available to corporate decision makers as well as
                        operational workers.

                        Cloud services means services made available to users on demand via the Internet
                        from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's
                        own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access
                        to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services
                        provider.<br>
                        A cloud service can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and because
                        the service provider supplies the hardware and software necessary for the service,
                        there�s no need for a company to provision or deploy its own resources or allocate
                        IT staff to manage the service. Examples of cloud services include online data storage
                        and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document

                        In business, outsourcing involves the contracting out of a business process to another
                        party. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one
                        firm to another, but not always. Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over
                        control of public services to for-profit corporations.
                        <br>
                        Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes
                        offshoring (relocating a business function to another country). Financial savings
                        from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing/offshoring.
                        <br>
                        The opposite of outsourcing, insourcing, entails bringing processes handled by third-party
                        firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration. However,
                        a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily
                        insourcing that business process.

                        ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA)

                    <p>
                        Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technology that allows employees in a 
                        company to configure computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret existing applications 
                        for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other 
                        digital systems.
                        <br>
                        RPA software isn't part of an organization's IT infrastructure. Instead, it is positioned on top 
                        of an organisation's existing technology, meaning that it is both complementary to core systems 
                        and non-disruptive for day-to-day business.
                        <br>
                        RPA does not require revisions to business-critical legacy systems. This platform simplifies 
                        processes based on business rules and events, automating the time-consuming work formerly 
                        requiring human interaction. Gaps between multiple applications/systems can be accomplished 
                        through event-driven automation, rather than requiring multiple manual tasks.
